A simple GUI created in Python using the built in Tkinter library. Uses the Pyperclip module to copy text to the clipboard.

For a lot of my assignments written in Microsoft Word or Google Docs, I had to use special characters that aren't part of the standard keyboard layout, such as Sigma or Pi. I didn't like having to look up a symbol to copy it every time I needed to use it, and I wanted a quicker way to copy a symbol to my clipboard. I knew some of the symbols had built in bindings, but I could never remember what they were and would also end up having to look those up. I figured I could create a simple GUI where I could just click on a button for a symbol and have it automatically copied to my clipboard.

I also included a lookup feature where you can type the name of a symbol and search it, and it copies the symbol if its found. There aren't that many symbols in the program, so this feature isn't very useful, I just wanted to get a little more practice with Tkinter and see how I could implement such a feature.

When you add buttons to TKinter GUI, it places them vertically by default. My original plan was to have the buttons in a grid layout, but I actually ended up really liking the vertical placement because I could keep the app in a thin vertical strip on the side of my browser.
